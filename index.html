      Hi. I'm a programmer and you can call me steady.
      My interests lie in embedded systems and robotics.
      I want to accomplish the following in the next two years:
      <ul>
        <li>Make a significant contribution to real-time Linux.</li>
        <li>Do research worthy of a publication.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you will join me as I undertake these goals.
