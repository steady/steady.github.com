  You appear to be absolutely incapable of realising that there are people 
  in this world who can see more than one side to a question
%p
  On the contrary. I see both sides, and I have evaluated both sides, and 
  I have found that one side is vastly superior to the other. This may 
  seem ruthless, but that's how engineering works.

  The most motivating thing there is in open source is personal pride.
  Does this mean that there will be tension and rivalry? Hell yes. But that's
  kind of the point. Life is a game, and if you aren't in it to win, what the
  heck are you still doing here?

  Life has to be more than about solving problems. If all that life is about is
  solving problems, why bother getting up in the morning? There have to be
  things that inspire you, that make you proud to be a member of humanity. 
  The Apollo program is certainly an example of that. Only a handful of people
  went to the moon. And yet, actually we all went to the moon.
