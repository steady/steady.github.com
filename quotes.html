      On the contrary. I see both sides, and I have evaluated both sides, and
      I have found that one side is vastly superior to the other. This may
      seem ruthless, but that's how engineering works.

      The most motivating thing there is in open source is personal pride.
      Does this mean that there will be tension and rivalry? Hell yes. But that's
      kind of the point. Life is a game, and if you aren't in it to win, what the
      heck are you still doing here?

      Life has to be more than about solving problems. If all that life is about is
      solving problems, why bother getting up in the morning? There have to be
      things that inspire you, that make you proud to be a member of humanity.

      One of the characteristics of successful scientists is having courage.
      They will go forward under incredible circumstances; they think and
      continue to think.
